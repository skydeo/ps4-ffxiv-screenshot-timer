Instructions to apply correct timestamps to screenshots from PS4:

1.	Build file list: ls -la > screenshotListing.txt
2.	Import screenshotListing.txt into Excel as fixed-width, separating out just file name
3.	Delete first column, use Excel file screenshotRetimeHelp.xlsx to calculate commands
	(This should just entail dropping in the filename column and making sure the calculated fields go all the way to the bottom of the list).
4.	Copy/paste the last column (N) into a text file (screenshotRetimeCommands.txt)
5.	Open in Atom, convert line endings to Unix format (Packages > Convert Line Endings To > Unix)
6.	Verify line endings are actually \n (od -c screenshotRetimeCommands.txt)
7.	Execute commands: bash screenshotRetimeCommands.txt
